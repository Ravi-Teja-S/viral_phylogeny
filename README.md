# Viral Phylogeny:

Phylogenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) using Biopython.

## Project Overview:

This project performs phylogenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences 
using Biopython. The workflow includes sequence retrieval, multiple sequence 
alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, and evolutionary analysis.

## Objectives:

- Retrieve viral genome sequences
- Perform sequence alignment
- Construct phylogenetic tree
- Analyze evolutionary relationships

## Tools and Libraries:

- Python
- Biopython
- NCBI database
- FASTA sequence files

## Methodology:

1. Collect SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in FASTA format.
2. Use Biopython to parse and process sequences.
3. Perform multiple sequence alignment.
4. Construct phylogenetic tree.
5. Visualize evolutionary relationships.
